# English Class Management — Canonical v3

Canonical v3 is deployed to the local production database and verified through
Phase 10. The checksum-matched cutover completed with zero open quality issues,
including restricted-role app smoke and backup/restore validation.

The current frontend includes the verified Phase 11 HR operations workflow
specified in `docs/reviews/phase-11-operations-workspace-spec.md`. Production
rollout validation is approved for the current workbook checksum and operational
issue snapshot after owner decisions for high-severity legacy data issues.

Phase 13.2 now provides HR-first learner start, continuation, rejoin, profile,
history, and transfer journeys while preserving the canonical service and audit
boundaries.

The pre-canonical prototype (old `app.py`, `etl.py`, `schema.sql`, `views.sql`,
`admin_schema.sql`, `setup.ps1`, `quality_checks.sql`) is archived under
`legacy/` and must not be run against the canonical database.  Use the
versioned migrations, staging loader, canonical ETL, and `streamlit_app.py`.

## Developer handoff

Read these documents in order before changing code or data:

1. `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` - field meaning and source of truth.
2. `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md` - entity grain and business invariants.
3. `PROJECT_RULES.md` - mandatory engineering and data-safety rules.
4. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - phased tasks, dependencies, tests, and gates.
5. `docs/reviews/phase-11-operations-workspace-spec.md` - approved HR workflow
   and UX acceptance criteria.
6. `DEVELOPER_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` - evidence required for every phase/PR.

## Verified canonical path

The current verified path is:

1. Create a PostgreSQL database.
2. Create restricted database roles and transfer canonical ownership with
   `database_roles.sql`.
3. Run `python migrate.py "<migration-role-database-url>"`.
4. Stage the workbook:
   `python scripts/stage_workbook.py okok_FIXED_v2.xlsx --database-url "<migration-role-database-url>" --profile-output docs/reviews/final-workbook-profile.json`
5. Run canonical ETL:
   `python scripts/canonical_etl_v3.py "<migration-role-database-url>"`.
6. Configure `APP_DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, or copy
   `.streamlit/secrets.example.toml` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and fill the
   restricted app role URL.
7. Create the first named app admin once:
   `python scripts/bootstrap_admin.py --username hr-admin --full-name "HR Admin"`.
8. Start the app with the checked Windows launcher:
   `.\run_app.cmd`

The launcher verifies Python packages, the restricted app database connection,
and the canonical schema before starting Streamlit at
`http://127.0.0.1:8501`.

The app requires a named application username and password so every operational
change and audit event is attributed to the HR user who performed it.

## Verification and backups

Fast business-rule regression suite (seconds, disposable `english_class_pytest`
database, no workbook load):

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/
```

Full verification battery (fast suite + dictionary check + phase 8/9/10/11
gates) in one command:

```powershell
.\scripts\run-all-gates.ps1            # everything
.\scripts\run-all-gates.ps1 -SkipHeavy # fast suite + dictionary check only
```

Daily database backup runs as the `EnglishClassDbBackup` scheduled task at
12:00 (catches up when the machine was off). It writes verified dumps to
`backups\` and `C:\Backups\english_class` with 30-day retention. Manual run:

```powershell
.\backup.ps1
```

Database URLs are read from the user-scoped `APP_DATABASE_URL` and
`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` environment variables (preferred over
`.streamlit/secrets.toml`, which should stay absent from synced folders).

Phase 9 rehearsal command:

```powershell
python scripts\phase9_cutover_rehearsal.py
```

The rehearsal also regenerates the Phase 11 operational issue snapshot.

Generate and validate the owner-facing quality sign-off snapshot:

```powershell
python scripts\phase10_quality_signoff.py
python scripts\phase10_quality_signoff.py --validate-decisions
```

The latest checksum-matched verification passes with zero open quality issues.

Generate and validate the Phase 11 operational issue snapshot:

```powershell
python scripts\phase11_operational_issue_snapshot.py
python scripts\phase11_operational_issue_snapshot.py --write-decision-template
python scripts\phase11_operational_issue_snapshot.py --apply-decision-template
python scripts\phase11_operational_issue_snapshot.py --validate-decisions
```

The validation command is expected to fail until the owner decisions in
`docs/reviews/phase-11-owner-decision-template.json` are completed and applied,
or the high-severity issues are resolved.

Latest rehearsal evidence is recorded in
`docs/reviews/phase-9-cutover-rehearsal.md`.

The current local production database is applied through
`019_phase13_makeup_link_immutability`, which additionally enforces one linked
make-up per original absence and excludes make-up units from the attendance
denominator while preserving present replacement credit and immutable linkage.

## Cutover safety

Production cutover completed on 2026-07-13. The pre-cutover legacy database and
verified backups are retained for rollback; use the Phase 9 runbook for restore
and verification steps.

## Known data-quality gaps (present in the original spreadsheet, handled not hidden)

- `emp_code` is stored as `float` in some sheets (e.g. PIC, Placement) and
  `string` in others (STUDENTS, ATTENDANCE_LOG) — the ETL normalizes all of
  these to `TEXT`.
- 6 (class_code, course_name) combinations appear in ATTENDANCE_LOG/sheet2
  but were missing a row in CLASS_DATES (e.g. `EL008` / `Business English`).
  The ETL adds them to `class_offerings` with a `NULL` start_date rather than
  dropping the attendance/enrollment data that depends on them.
- 21 attendance rows have no matching row in `enrollments` (sheet2) — real
  gaps in the source data entry. They are retained with a nullable
  `enrollment_id` and surfaced in `data_quality_issues` for correction.
- Session order and timestamp are both inconsistent in parts of the source.
  Some learners have the same order on different dates, and some timestamps
  carry multiple credited orders. The v3 model separates meetings from session
  units and routes ambiguous legacy groups to data-quality review.
- 57 Placement rows reference an `emp_code` not present in STUDENTS (likely
  candidates who never became active students) — kept, with `emp_code` set
  to `NULL` and `full_name` preserved as free text.
- Level labels like `"⏳ Chưa test"` / `"not placement"` (case mismatch with
  `"Not Placement"`) don't match `level_helper` and are stored as `NULL`.

## Legacy architecture (superseded)

`classes -> class_offerings -> class_sessions -> attendance_log` represents
the teaching schedule. `students -> enrollments -> attendance_log` represents
who joined it. `students.current_enrollment_id` explicitly selects the current
enrollment used by `v_student_current`; the old `students.current_*` columns
remain only as fallback data from the spreadsheet.

This architecture is retained only to explain the prototype. The target model
is defined in `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Legacy commands - archived, do not run for canonical v3

The referenced files now live in `legacy/`.

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f legacy/schema.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f legacy/views.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f legacy/admin_schema.sql
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 legacy/etl.py okok_FIXED_v2.xlsx "$DATABASE_URL"
python3 migrate.py "$DATABASE_URL"
```

For canonical v3, use the verified path at the top of this README and the
Phase 9 cutover runbook.
